The Wi-Fi Risk Meter is an interactive web-based simulation created to demonstrate how public Wi-Fi security can be analyzed and visualized in real time. The project was developed as part of an internship focused on cybersecurity awareness and user education.

Public Wi-Fi networks, such as those in cafes, airports, and stations, often lack strong encryption, leaving users vulnerable to data theft or unauthorized access. The Wi-Fi Risk Meter addresses this concern by simulating the process of assessing network safety in an engaging and accessible way.

With a single click on the Start button, the interface mimics a live network scan and instantly displays the risk level of various Wi-Fi connections. The tool categorizes networks as Safe, Moderate, or High Risk, based on simulated parameters such as encryption standards (Open, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3). The visual output includes a dynamic animation inspired by Speedtest interfaces, providing an intuitive experience that helps users understand their network’s security status at a glance.

While the current version operates as a simulation, since web browsers cannot access actual Wi-Fi hardware for security reasons, it effectively demonstrates the underlying logic of real-world network risk assessment systems. The emphasis is on concept visualization, cybersecurity awareness, and user experience design rather than live data collection.

This project showcases fundamental concepts of front-end web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with design thinking focused on simplicity, usability, and engagement. The simulated nature of the tool ensures full compatibility across platforms—Windows, macOS, and Linux—making it easy to access and present through GitHub Pages.

In essence, the Wi-Fi Risk Meter serves as an educational demonstration of how users can be informed about wireless network security risks through intelligent interface design. It reflects the growing need to balance cybersecurity with user-friendly technology, promoting awareness of safe online behavior in everyday digital life.
